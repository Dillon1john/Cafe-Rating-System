# Cafe-Rating-System
Created a web service that stores user ratings on specified cafes based on coffee rating, wifi strength, and plug availability. Web service utilizes Flask and Jinja2 to create the website pages as well as Flask-bootstrap for styling. Flask-WTF and wtfforms are used to create the input forms and validators for the fields. The data inputted by users is then appended to a csv file that is displayed in a table located on a separate page.
